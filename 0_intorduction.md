# Introduction

This are my own notes, so pretty random, all chaos, no rules here. <br>
Hmm, so course is from Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
 <br>
 Taught by: Simon Schocken and Noam Nisan
 <br>

 Course in 2 parts:
 1. Hardware
 2. Software

 My Goal: I wanna build few things from scratch, one is compiler, one is ray tracer, one is fluid simulator and few more. On the other hand, I am ML engineer and I wanna start implementing multiple research papers from scratch. But as I spent years writing high level code, working on top of libraries, writing backends and working on prod stuff, I need some experience with low level stuff and how things actually works. <br>
 My main goal for implementing papers from scratch is that if I understand things at bottom, I can make optimizations which is all I need and am intereasted in, other than HPC right now.
 Siddharth, see you on other side of repo.

 Note: I just bought my first mechanical keyboard today (yay!) and getting used to typing on this device so expecting lots of typos in repo but this is just for me so, let's do it.
